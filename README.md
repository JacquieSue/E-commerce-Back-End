# E-commerce-Back-End
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) 

## Description
As a developer, I want to show potential employers that I understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.  I will demonstrate this by building a back end for an e-commerce site, and configuring an Express API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Usage

GIVEN a functional Express.js API

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
